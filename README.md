# BDD
The project is made to performe a task of ntaking values from a uiser and returning a comment as to weather the 3 values form a triangle type or totally not form a triangle.
## The following are the conditions
1. Equilateral: All sides are equal.
* For instance, if 3,3,3 form the 3 sides of a triangle, then it is an Equilateral.
2. Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
* For instance, if 3,3,2 form the three sides of a triangle,sonce the two sides have equal lengths, It is an Isosceles triangle
3. Scalene: No sides are equal. 
* If 3,4,5 form the 3 sides, since no side has equal lenth than the other,the a triangle formed is of Scalene type.
4.NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
Sometimes not all provided lenghs form any type of triangle. For instance 1,2,3 are the sides, the sum of any two of the sides is either equal to or less than the leghth of the third side, that is 1+2<=3, since this condition is true, this values cannot form a triangle of any given type
